# Financial dashboard

This is a simple financial dashboard, allowing users to plot several different
tickers of their choice from the S&P 500.

There will be an element of real-time functionality, although this will take the
form of Plotly Dash interval component. 

This will be in a dark theme, so I will be looking for something css like that
